# Titanic Passenger Data Analysis — Data Science Project

## Overview
This project contains a complete data analysis project focused on the Titanic passenger dataset.  
It demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical methods, and visualizations using the R programming language.

The project was originally created as an academic assignment and now serves as part of a broader Data Science portfolio. This was one of my first projects (done at the beggining of studies) and it presents my first steps in Data Science.

## Contents
- **Titanic_analysis.pdf** — original project report (cleaned, without code)
- **titanic_code.R** — full R script used for preprocessing and statistical analysis
- **titanic_new.csv** — dataset
- **README.md** — this file


## Requirements
To run the R script:

- R (version 4.0 or newer)
- Required packages:
  - tidyverse  
  - corrplot  
  - ggplot2  


## How to Run
1. Place `titanic_new.csv` inside the **data/** folder.
2. Open the `analysis.R` file in RStudio.
3. Run the entire script to reproduce the analysis, visualizations, and results.


## Project Purpose
This project demonstrates:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Statistical correlation analysis
- Working with visualizations in R
- Good analytical and documentation practices

The project reflects early-stage analytical skills and academic foundations, while still being clean, well-organized, and replicable.
